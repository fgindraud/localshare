# So.... avahi. FIXME
# Avahi doesn't want to publish services if only loopback interface is available.
# Avahi is available on Travis machines, but there is only loopback...
# So the transfer test just hangs and waits. So it has been deactivated.
# - Avahi config options are of no help
# - Replace with mDNSResponder ?
# - What about dns resolution for .local services ?
ip link # check only loopback TODO remove
